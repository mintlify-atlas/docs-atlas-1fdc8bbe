description: Set up Go and install the neural network library to get started with MNIST digit classification
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

### Go programming language

This project requires **Go 1.24.3** or later.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check if Go is installed">
    Run the following command to check your Go version:
    
    ```bash
    go version
    ```
    
    If Go is not installed or you need to upgrade, continue to the next step.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install or upgrade Go">
    Download and install Go from the official website:
    
    [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/)
    
    Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify installation">
    After installation, verify that Go is properly configured:
    
    ```bash
    go version
    # Should output: go version go1.24.3 or later
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Clone the repository

Get the source code from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yangleyland/Go-Neural-Network.git
cd Go-Neural-Network
```

## Install dependencies

The project uses the Gonum library for matrix operations. Install all dependencies:

```bash
go mod download
```

### Key dependencies

The project requires the following packages (automatically installed via `go mod download`):

- **gonum.org/v1/gonum**: Scientific computing library for matrix operations
- **golang.org/x/image**: Image processing utilities

<Note>
  All dependencies are specified in `go.mod` and will be automatically downloaded when you run `go mod download`.
</Note>

## Get the MNIST dataset

The network trains on the MNIST database of handwritten digits. You need to download the dataset in CSV format.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the dataset directory">
    ```bash
    mkdir mnist_dataset
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Download the training data">
    Download `mnist_train.csv` and place it in the `mnist_dataset` directory.
    
    You can get the MNIST dataset in CSV format from:
    - [Kaggle MNIST Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv)
    - [pjreddie.com MNIST CSV](https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Download the test data">
    Download `mnist_test.csv` and place it in the `mnist_dataset` directory.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify the dataset structure">
    Your directory should look like this:
    
    ```
    Go-Neural-Network/
    ├── mnist_dataset/
    │   ├── mnist_train.csv
    │   └── mnist_test.csv
    ├── cmd/
    ├── internal/
    └── ...
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  The MNIST CSV files are large (around 100MB for training data). Make sure you have sufficient disk space and a stable internet connection.
</Warning>

## Create data directory

The network saves trained model weights to a `data` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p data
```

This directory will store:
- `hweights.model`: Hidden layer weights
- `oweights.model`: Output layer weights

## Build the project

Compile the Go program:

```bash
go build -o neural-network cmd/main.go
```

This creates an executable named `neural-network` in your current directory.

## Verify installation

Confirm that everything is set up correctly:

```bash
./neural-network -h
```

You should see the program run without errors (it won't show help text since the implementation doesn't include it, but it will execute successfully).

## Project structure

Here's an overview of the project layout:

```
Go-Neural-Network/
├── cmd/
│   └── main.go              # Main application entry point
├── internal/
│   └── perceptron/
│       └── perceptron.go    # Neural network implementation
├── mnist_dataset/           # MNIST training and test data
│   ├── mnist_train.csv
│   └── mnist_test.csv
├── data/                    # Saved model weights
│   ├── hweights.model
│   └── oweights.model
├── nums/                    # Custom PNG images for testing
├── go.mod                   # Go module definition
└── go.sum                   # Dependency checksums
```

## Troubleshooting

### Go version mismatch

If you encounter errors about Go version compatibility:

```bash
go mod edit -go=1.21  # Adjust to your Go version if needed
go mod tidy
```

### Missing dependencies

If you see import errors:

```bash
go mod tidy
go mod download
```

### Dataset format issues

Ensure your MNIST CSV files have the correct format:
- First column: the digit label (0-9)
- Remaining 784 columns: pixel values (0-255)

## Next steps

Now that you have everything installed, you're ready to train your first neural network:
