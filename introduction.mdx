description: A neural network implementation from scratch in Go for MNIST handwritten digit classification with 97% accuracy
---

## Overview

This is a fully-featured neural network built from scratch in Go, designed to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The implementation uses no high-level machine learning frameworks, instead building the network using matrix operations from the Gonum library.

The network achieves **97% accuracy** on the MNIST test set, demonstrating that simple feedforward networks can still be highly effective for image classification tasks.

## Network architecture

The neural network uses a straightforward three-layer architecture:

- **Input layer**: 784 neurons (28×28 pixel images flattened)
- **Hidden layer**: 200 neurons with sigmoid activation
- **Output layer**: 10 neurons (digits 0-9) with sigmoid activation

The network is trained using backpropagation with gradient descent, implementing the following:

- Sigmoid activation function
- Forward propagation for predictions
- Backpropagation for weight updates
- Adjustable learning rate (default: 0.1)

## How it works

The implementation consists of two main components:

### 1. Network structure

The `Network` struct in `internal/perceptron/perceptron.go` contains:

```go
type Network struct {
    Inputs        int
    hiddens       int
    Outputs       int
    HiddenWeights *mat.Dense
    OutputWeights *mat.Dense
    learningRate  float64
}
```

### 2. Training and prediction

The network provides two core methods:

- **Train()**: Performs forward propagation, calculates errors, and updates weights using backpropagation
- **Predict()**: Runs forward propagation to generate predictions for new inputs

<Note>
  The network normalizes all pixel values to a range of 0.01-1.0 to improve training stability.
</Note>

## Use cases

This neural network is perfect for:

- Learning how neural networks work under the hood
- Understanding backpropagation and gradient descent
- Building custom digit recognition systems
- Educational purposes and experimentation
- Baseline for comparing more complex architectures
